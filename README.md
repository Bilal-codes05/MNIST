# MNIST Digit Classification Model

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is widely used as a benchmark for machine learning and deep learning models.

## Features
- Model: A CNN built using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Dataset: The MNIST dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits (0-9).
- Output: Classification of images into one of 10 classes (digits 0 through 9).

## Installation
To run the project, ensure you have Python installed (>=3.8) and the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Training the Model
1. Load the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow/Keras.
2. Train the CNN model using the training dataset.
3. Validate the model on the test dataset.

### Predicting Digits
Use the trained model to classify images of handwritten digits. Load the model and pass an input image for prediction.

## Files
- `model.py`: Contains the code for building, training, and evaluating the CNN model.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the project.
- `README.md`: This file with details about the project.

## Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of ~99% on the test dataset.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the script `model.py` to train and evaluate the model.
4. (Optional) Use the script to load the model and make predictions.
